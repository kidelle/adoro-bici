# Adoro Bici

‘Adoro Bici’ is a web application for a bike rental and souvenir shop located on Madeline Island. The app will enable the user to browse different bikes and mopeds that are available to rent. There will be a feature that will allow the user to reserve a bike for a specific date and time. The user will be able to edit their reservation or delete it completely.
